# GBM-PTEN-Data

This repository contains the whole-exome sequencing (WES) results derived from GBM-PTEN organoid experiments. These data support the analysis of genomic alterations associated with PTEN-deficient glioblastoma organoid models.

The RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset generated from the same GBM-PTEN organoid experiments is publicly available on Zenodo under DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.15686705](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15686705).
